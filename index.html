<h1>Welcome to InfoFound!</h1>
 <h2>Our Mission</h2>
 <p>The goal of InfoFound is to bridge the gap between the hearing world and deaf community. While there is a large disparity between the two, the goal of this site is to also educate parents about how to work with their children in order to allow for proper growth and development. We touch upon topics ranging from education to local hospitals and one of our more notable features allows parents to learn ASL.</p>
